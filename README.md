# index_investing

### Description

This is a Python program that calculates user-defined dollar cost averaging strategies in a given index/stock. 
The program shows you how well a dollar cost averaging strategy does by performing the strategy using historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance.
This allows for easy comparisons between different strategies, for example we are able to compare the performance of dollar cost averaging in the S&P 500 by buying on the first day of every month or the last day of every month.

**The project is still under development**

### How to run
1. Have Python and pip installed
2. Install all the requirements: ``pip install -r requirements.txt``
3. Run the program: ``python ./index_investing.py``

### How to use
TODO

### Development
Ideas:
- Make the program generic for the index/stock
- Create a UI

In Progress:
- Implement random strategy (random day of month)
